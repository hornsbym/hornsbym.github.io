        <div class="orangeStoryPreview">
            <p>"The man climbed the three steps to his front porch. He noticed, through the frosted glass 
                on his front door, that the kitchen lights were still on. Great, he thought to himself. No use trying 
                to be quiet. 
                He opened his front door, not bothering to stifle the rattle of his keys against the door, 
                and then let it close loudly. After hanging his cap on the wall next to the door, he made his way 
                into the kitchen."  </p>

    <div class="whiteStoryPreview">
        <p>"I crash through the brush, swiping away vines and branches as I dash through the trees. 
            Despite the darkness of the forest, I manage to scramble forward. Not so far behind, dead 
            branches snap and falling trees thud. I’m not sure what could be big enough to topple trees, but I 
            don’t want to find out." </p>
